Personalized Audio Travel Guide App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Executive Summary
The Personalized Audio Travel Guide app is a location-based, dynamically generated audio tour guide for users. The app will use real-time data (POIs, maps, and user preferences) to generate personalized walking tours. Users can specify their interests, time, and distance preferences, and the app will create a route that provides narrated audio content at each stop, guiding them through historical landmarks, nature spots, museums, restaurants, and more. The app will work in both online and offline modes, making it perfect for travelers on-the-go.

2. Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: To provide a flexible, personalized, and immersive walking tour experience for travelers.
Secondary Goal: To allow users to discover interesting places, learn through audio guides, and explore cities, parks, and cultural hubs at their own pace.
Additional Goals:
Build a scalable, real-time tour generation system based on dynamic location and user inputs.
Enable offline mode for travelers without consistent internet connectivity.
Create a UI/UX that is intuitive, simple, and user-friendly.
3. Key Features and Functionality
3.1 User Onboarding
Sign-Up/Login: Basic user authentication (email, Google, Facebook, or Apple login).
User Preferences: Upon first use, prompt users to set their preferences:
Interests: (Nature, History, Food, Art, etc.)
Time: (30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, etc.)
Distance: (Up to 1 km, 3 km, 5 km, etc.)
Pace: (Casual, Moderate, Brisk)
3.2 Tour Generation
Dynamic Tour Creation:
The app will fetch real-time data from APIs like Google Places, Foursquare, or OpenStreetMap to gather nearby Points of Interest (POIs) based on user preferences.
The app will calculate an optimized walking route between the selected POIs, ensuring that the tour fits the user's time and distance constraints.
Route Calculation:
Routes will be generated based on geographic proximity, relevance to the selected interests, and feasibility within the user’s time/distance constraints.
The app should display the route on a map (using Google Maps API, Mapbox, or Leaflet) and guide users between stops.
3.3 Audio Narration
Each POI along the route will have an associated audio guide that provides an engaging description of the location. This can be achieved with:
Pre-recorded audio clips for popular locations (e.g., landmarks, museums).
Text-to-Speech (TTS) for less common or user-submitted POIs.
Option to pause/resume audio.
Option for the user to toggle audio on/off or switch to text-based descriptions.
3.4 Navigation and Directions
Turn-by-Turn Navigation:
The app will guide the user with real-time navigation to the next stop.
It will offer re-routing options if the user deviates from the planned path.
POI Details:
Each stop on the route will show relevant details such as name, description, images, ratings, and any available reviews.
3.5 User Interaction and Feedback
Rating and Reviewing: After completing a tour, users can rate and review the experience.
Suggestions and Customization: Users can change route preferences on-the-fly (e.g., skip stops, modify time/distance).
Crowdsourced Content: Users can suggest new POIs to add to the database or even submit reviews/photos.
3.6 Offline Mode
The app should function without an internet connection:
POIs and routes will be pre-loaded based on location and saved for offline use.
Cached data should include basic descriptions and audio files to ensure the user experience is smooth even without connectivity.
3.7 Map and UI/UX
Main Screen:
Display an interactive map with the user’s current location and route to the first POI.
Show the route along with markers for each POI.
POI List: A list of stops with brief descriptions.
Navigation Controls: Buttons for starting/pausing the tour, toggling between audio/text descriptions.
Tour Summary: At the end of the tour, show a summary with options for sharing the tour, rating the experience, and suggesting improvements.
4. Technical Requirements
4.1 APIs and Data Sources
Google Places API: For fetching POI information (name, description, photos, etc.).
OpenStreetMap: For geographic data and routing (alternative to Google Maps for open-source data).
Foursquare API: For additional POIs (especially for restaurants, shops, etc.).
Mapbox: (Optional) For advanced map customizations and styling.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) API: For converting descriptions into spoken narration (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, IBM Watson TTS).
Location Services: For accurate GPS tracking of the user’s position.
4.2 Platform
Frontend: Built using Next.js for rendering UI components dynamically, integrating APIs, and handling user interactions.
Backend: Supabase for authentication, database storage (user preferences, tour history, feedback), and any real-time data syncing.
Mobile-Friendly Web App: The app should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
4.3 Features for Mobile (Optional)
Location Tracking: Ensure real-time tracking of the user’s location for seamless tour navigation.
Offline Caching: Implement caching of data (POIs, maps, audio) for offline use.
Push Notifications: Send alerts for nearby POIs or suggested detours during the tour.
