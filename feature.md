## Required Features for MVP

### Authentication
- ‚ùå Complete Supabase authentication integration
- ‚ùå Login functionality
- ‚ùå Registration functionality
- ‚ùå User profile management
- ‚ùå Protected routes for authenticated users

### Tour Generation
- ‚ùå Connect to Google Places API for POI data
- ‚ùå Algorithm to generate tours based on user interests with specific heuristics:
  - User's distance preference determines the search radius for POIs
  - User's duration preference determines the number of POIs to include
  - Selection prioritizes POIs with highest review counts and ratings > 4.0
  - Ensure total tour time (including travel between POIs) meets user's duration preference
- ‚ùå Transportation mode selection (walking, public transit)
- ‚ùå Tour routing based on user location and preferences
- ‚ùå Saving generated tours to user profile
- ‚ùå Viewing saved tours

### Audio Features
- ‚ùå Integration with Text-to-Speech API
- ‚ùå Audio content generation based on POI data
- ‚ùå Audio player interface
- ‚ùå Downloading tours for offline use
- ‚ùå Audio controls (play, pause, skip)

### Navigation
- ‚ùå Turn-by-turn navigation for tours
- ‚ùå Proximity detection for POI narration
- ‚ùå Tour progress tracking
- ‚ùå Distance and time remaining calculations

### User Experience Enhancements
- ‚ùå Tour rating system
- ‚ùå Bookmarking favorite locations
- ‚ùå Sharing tours with other users
- ‚ùå Recommended tours based on popularity/user preferences

## Technical Dependencies

### Current
- Google Maps JavaScript API (for map display)
- Supabase (for authentication and database)
- Next.js & React (frontend framework)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

### Planned
- Google Places API (for POI data)
- Text-to-Speech API (OpenAI or alternative)
- Geolocation APIs (for precise location tracking)

## Known Limitations & Considerations

1. **API Usage Costs**: 
   - Google Maps API has usage limits and costs beyond free tier
   - Text-to-Speech services typically charge per character/request

2. **Data Sources for "Hidden Gems"**:
   - Currently limited to standard POIs from Google Places
   - Finding truly "hidden" locations requires specialized data sources

3. **Transportation Modes**:
   - Initial version will focus on walking tours
   - Public transit integration adds complexity but expands tour range
   - Need to consider time spent in transit vs. exploring

4. **Offline Functionality**:
   - Will need to implement caching for offline tour playback
   - Maps may require additional implementation for offline use

5. **Battery Usage**:
   - Continuous GPS tracking can drain device batteries
   - Need to optimize location update frequency

6. **Accessibility**:
   - Audio content needs to be supplemented with text for accessibility
   - UI needs to meet accessibility standards

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Complete authentication and basic tour generation
2. **Phase 2**: Implement audio generation and playback
3. **Phase 3**: Add navigation features and tour progress tracking
4. **Phase 4**: Enhance with social features and recommendations
5. **Phase 5**: Optimize for performance and offline use
6. **Future Enhancements**: Ride-sharing integration for longer distances between POIs
